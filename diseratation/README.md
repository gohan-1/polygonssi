# Hardhat Project Setup and Running Guide

This project uses Hardhat for smart contract development, testing, and deployment, along with Node.js for backend functionality.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Hardhat Setup

To create a new Hardhat project, run:

```bash
npx hardhat
```

Follow the prompts to set up your Hardhat project.

### 4. Compile Smart Contracts

To compile your smart contracts, use the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### 5. Running Tests

To run the tests defined in your project, use:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### 6. Deploying Contracts

To deploy your contracts, ensure you have configured your deployment script and then run:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your-network>
```

Replace `<your-network>` with the appropriate network name defined in your `hardhat.config.js`.

### 7. Running a Local Development Network

You can start a local Ethereum network for testing purposes with:

```bash
npx hardhat node
```

### 8. Interacting with Contracts

You can interact with your deployed contracts using Hardhat console:

```bash
npx hardhat console --network <your-network>
```

## Running the Node.js Server

If your project includes a Node.js server, you can start it by running:

```bash
node server.js
```

or if you are using a framework like Express:

```bash
npm start
```

## Additional Scripts

You can also include other helpful npm scripts in your `package.json` file. For example:

- `npm run lint` - Lint your code using ESLint.
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate test coverage report.
